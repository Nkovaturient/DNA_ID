  "description": "With the burgeoning influx of knowledge and research data surmounting, there is a need to recognize and analyse how decentralized knowledge (metadata) is created, governed, and consumed-- safely, ethically, and inclusively. Hence, our next-gen decentralized identity infrastructure aims to streamline identification of metadata and knowledge creation."
  "Powered by the intelligence of BioAgents, reasoning of LangChain, and the permanence of Filecoin via Powergate, DNA_ID anchors verifiable identity through trusted VC issuance, user-centric control and enriched metadata. Seamlessly integrated with the Dataverse ecosystem, its a revolution to one's knowledge coded decentralized identity fostering trust and sustainability ."
