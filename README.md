## Objectives
- **A scalable, GDPR-compliant Decentralised Identifier (DID) system** as a sustainable, user-centric addition to existing persistent identifier infrastructures (DOI, Handle).
- **Integrate with Dataverse** and demonstrate through AI applications to showcase decentralised metadata management and user empowerment in cultural heritage data contexts.
- **Deliver a prototype DID system compatible with GDPR.**
- **Reduce costs** associated with massive identifier creation.
- **Enhance user control** over personal metadata.
- **Increase data accessibility and community engagement.**
- **Align with major priorities:** inclusivity, security, and sustainability.

## Setting Up Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nkovaturient/DNA_ID.git
   cd DNA_ID
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (Dataverse API, blockchain endpoints, etc).

    `cp .env.example .env`

4. **Run the development server:**
  - Frontend(from current path)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Backend -- open another terminal

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the app:**
   - Access [frontend](http://localhost:5173) in your browser and
   - Open [server](http://localhost:3000) and verify its running.

## Further Enhancements
- Full integration of all UI flows with backend endpoints
- Advanced consent management and user notifications
- Multi-factor authentication and advanced security
- More granular metadata enrichment and explainability
- Accessibility and internationalization improvements
- Automated testing and CI/CD
- Community documentation and tutorials

## Potentiality of the Project
- **Transform persistent identifier infrastructure** for research, cultural heritage, and open science.
- **Empower users** with control over their digital identity and metadata.
- **Enable new AI-driven applications** for data discovery, enrichment, and compliance.
- **Foster inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability** in digital infrastructure.
